Fashion Quest
===

Fashion Quest is an interactive fiction framework being created so we can make
a text adventure game about fashion because we love fashion and we love text
adventure games.

You need Shoes to use this so download Shoes now to your computer:

Games created with the framework define the game using YAML files and bits of
Ruby. Four test games come with the source. 

The game "Fashion Quest: Daydream" is very small and mainly for demo purposes.
It lives in the "game" directory.

The game "Pirate Adventure Knockoff" is a port of the 1978 text adventure 
"Pirate Adventure" by Scott Adams and lives in the "pirate_adventure" directory.

The game "Cloak of Darkness" is a port of a game that is used to compare IF
frameworks. It shows how a game can be defined using one file (as is possible
with games written using Inform and other frameworks). It lives in the
"cloak_of_darkness" directory.

There is game stump in the "new_game" directory that can be used as a blank
slate when starting development of a new game. 

To try any of these use Shoes to open run.rb and select which you'd like
to play.

Documentation is slowly evolving and can be found in:
